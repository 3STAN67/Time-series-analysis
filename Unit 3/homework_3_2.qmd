## Questions

### Question 1 - Context and Measurement (10 points)

The first part of any time series analysis is context. You cannot properly analyze data without knowing what the data is measuring. Without context, the most simple features of data can be obscure and inscrutable. This homework assignment will center around the series below.

Please research the time series. In the spaces below, give the data collection process, unit of analysis, and meaning of each observation for the series.

#### **US Mortality**

<https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#>

Note: The data is self-explanatory, don't get lost in the documentation page.

### Question 2 - US Mortality Rate: Visualization (30 points)

##### a) Please plot the US Mortality Rate series (mortality per 100,000).

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}




```
:::

##### b) Use the exponential smoothing method to model the US Mortality Rate series. Use the smoothing parameter that R calculates by minimizing the SS1PE. Add it to the plot in 2a

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}



```
:::

##### c) Please repeat the modeling above but instead choose a smoothing parameter value $\alpha=0.2$. Add it to the plot in 2a

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}


```
:::

##### d) Please repeat the modeling above but instead choose a smoothing parameter value $\alpha=\frac{1}{n}$.Add it to the plot in 2a

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}



```
:::

##### d) Which of the smoothing parameter values you tried before work best for the series? Justify your answer.

### Question 5 - US Mortality Rate: Excess Mortality (30 points)

The jump at the last two years of the US Mortality Rate series is clearly the effect that Covid-19 had on mortality across the US.

##### a) Please calculate the excess mortality rate during 2020 and 2021 using the smoothing parameter values you employed in the previous question. Your results should be displayed in a table that is professionally formatted.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
```{r}



```
:::

##### b) What is the meaning of excess mortality as you calculated it? Please explain it to a general audience, as if you were being interviewed in a national news show.

::: {.callout-note title="Answer" icon="false"}
<!-- Delete this and put your answer here. The three colons mark the end of your answer. -->
:::

##### c) Which excess mortality rate estimate do you think is correct? Some commentators would suggest you are choosing the parameters to defend your political goals, not to conduct a scientific analysis. Please comment on the difficulty of choosing parameter values to estimate the death toll of Covid-19.

They may fail to provide relatable examples or context, making it difficult for the audience to understand the concept and its significance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Question 3c: Evaluation of assumptions used for inference** | Responses address the challenge of selecting parameter values to make inference in time series. They provide a comprehensive analysis, considering factors like modeling assumptions, and methodological variations that influence parameter selection. Explanations highlight the need of transparent reporting to ensure robust and reliable estimates in professional discourse. | Below expectations, responses may lack depth or clarity in addressing the challenge of selecting parameter values for making inference in time series. They may overlook key factors influencing parameter selection, such as data quality or specific characteristics of the time series data. Additionally, they may not effectively consider the impact of modeling assumptions or methodological variations on parameter selection. Furthermore, they may fail to emphasize the importance of transparent reporting in ensuring the reliability and validity of estimates, potentially resulting in a lack of confidence in the conclusions drawn from the analysis. |
